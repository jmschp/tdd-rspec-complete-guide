# 27. Implicit Subject

If we have a class as the first argument to describe, an instance of that class is exposed to each example in that example group via the `subject` method. Just like the `let` method, `subject` is also lazy loaded, to make it instanciante eagerly use `subject!`.

This works for class than can be instantiated without arguments. If our class requires some argumentes to be instantiated we need an explicit `subject`.

The example below, RSpec is instantiating an empty hash within the `subject` variable.

```ruby
RSpec.describe Hash do
  # let(:my_hash) { {} }

  it 'starts off empty' do
    expect(subject.length).to eq(0)
    subject[:some_key] = 'Some Value'
    expect(subject.length).to eq(1)
  end

  it 'is isolated between examples' do
    expect(subject.length).to eq(0)
  end
end
```
