# 57. Class Doubles

Class doubles are similar to instance doubles, but they verify the methods on the classes. Using the `as_stubbed_const`, and call to the specified class will be replaced with the double. Just like `instance_double` if the class has not been defined we can pass a string as the name and it behaves as a normal double.

```ruby
class Deck
  def self.build
    # Business logic to build a whole bunch of cards
  end
end

class CardGame
  attr_reader :cards

  def start
    @cards = Deck.build
  end
end

RSpec.describe CardGame do
  it 'can only implement class methods that are defined on a class' do
    deck_klass = class_double(Deck, build: %w[Ace Queen]).as_stubbed_const

    expect(deck_klass).to receive(:build)
    subject.start
    expect(subject.cards).to eq(%w[Ace Queen])
  end
end
```
