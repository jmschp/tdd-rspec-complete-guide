# 56. Instance Doubles

The `instance_double` method allows us to setup verifying doubles. This type of doubles check that the methods being stubbed are actually present on the underlying object if it is available. If the class as not been defined it behaves like a normal `double`.

With this technic we can guarantee that that our doubles actually have the stubbed methods implemented, and are not complete fiction.
