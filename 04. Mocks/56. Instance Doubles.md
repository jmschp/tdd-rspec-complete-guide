# 56. Instance Doubles

The `instance_double` method allows us to setup verifying doubles. This type of doubles check that the methods being stubbed are actually present on the underlying object if it is available. If the class as not been defined it behaves like a normal `double`.

With this technic we can guarantee that that our doubles actually have the stubbed methods implemented, and are not complete fiction.

```ruby
class Person
  def a(seconds)
    sleep(seconds)
    'Hello'
  end
end

RSpec.describe Person do
  describe 'regular double' do
    it 'can implement any method' do
      person = double(a: 'Hello', b: 20)
      expect(person.a).to eq('Hello')
    end
  end

  describe 'instance double' do
    it 'can only implement methods that are defined on the class' do
      # person = instance_double(Person, a: 'Hello', b: 20) # the b stub would raise an error, because the Person class does not implement an instance method b.

      person = instance_double(Person)
      allow(person).to receive(:a).with(3).and_return('Hello')
      expect(person.a(3)).to eq('Hello')
    end
  end
end
```
