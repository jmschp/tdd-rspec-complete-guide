# 52. Replacing an Object with a Double

In this test we replace the real `Actor` object, in [movie.rb](../lib/movie.rb), with a `double`. The `double`, will mimic the real `Actor` behavior. This is useful because in `Actor` we could have some expensive calculation, that we do not need to run during test. This way we can just skip the calculation and set a return value for methods we need.

The example below, is based on **behavior verification**, we test that our `double` received the proper messages, making this `double` a Mock. As we can see in the example, using this technic, we first set our expectations, and after we run our exercise, in this case `movie.start_shotting`

```ruby
RSpec.describe Movie do
  subject(:movie) { described_class.new(stuntmen) }

  let(:stuntmen) { double('Mr. Danger', ready?: true, act: 'I am acting', fall_off_lader: 'Sure', light_on_fire: true) }

  describe '#start_shotting' do
    it 'expect an actor to do 3 actions' do
      movie.start_shotting
      expect(stuntmen).to have_received(:ready?)
      expect(stuntmen).to receive(:act)
      expect(stuntmen).to receive(:fall_off_lader)
      expect(stuntmen).to receive(:light_on_fire)

      movie.start_shotting
    end
  end
end

```
