# 25. Nested Logic: Hooks

With the nested blocks we will have the following behavior. Outer hooks are valid whitin nested blocks and will run as well.

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'nested hooks' do
  before(:context) do
    puts 'OUTER Before context'
  end

  after(:context) do
    puts 'OUTER After context'
  end

  before do
    puts 'OUTER Before example'
  end

  after do
    puts 'OUTER After example'
  end

  it 'does basic math' do
    puts 'In example 1'
    expect(1 + 1).to eq(2)
  end

  context 'with condition A' do
    before(:context) do
      puts 'INNER Before context'
    end

    before do
      puts 'INNER Before example'
    end

    it 'does some more basic math' do
      puts 'In example 2'
      expect(1 + 1).to eq(2)
    end

    it 'does subtraction as well' do
      puts 'In example 3'
      expect(5 - 3).to eq(2)
    end
  end
end
```

This would have the following output:

```sh
rspec -- ./spec/nested_hooks_spec.rb

nested hooks
OUTER Before context
OUTER Before example
In example 1
OUTER After example
  does basic math
  with condition A
INNER Before context
OUTER Before example
INNER Before example
In example 2
OUTER After example
    does some more basic math
OUTER Before example
INNER Before example
In example 3
OUTER After example
    does subtraction as well
OUTER After context
