# 18. Reducing Duplication - Before Hooks and Instance Variables

## Hooks

A Hook is a piece of code that runs at a specific time during the execution of the test suite. We have `before`, `after`, and `around` hooks.

```ruby
RSpec.describe Card do
  before do
    puts 'This will run before each example.'
  end

  after do
    puts 'This will run after each example.'
  end

  it 'has a rank' do
    card = Card.new('Ace', 'Spades')
    expect(card.rank).to eq('Ace')
  end

  it 'has a suite' do
    card = Card.new('Ace', 'Spades')
    expect(card.suit).to eq('Spades')
  end
end
```
