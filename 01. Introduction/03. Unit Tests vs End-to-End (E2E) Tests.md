# 03. Unit Tests vs End-to-End (E2E) Tests

## Types of test

There are 4 main categories of test:

1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. System test
4. End-to-end tests (E2E)

### Unit Tests

Unit test usually comprise the largest portion of our test suite. This test focus on individual units of our application, like for example, testing a single module, class, or method. The elements are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. Usually they are the easiest to write and run faster.

### Integration tests

Integration and System test are in between Unit and E2E tests. This test focus on the interaction of several parts of the application.

### End-to-end tests (E2E)

End-to-end or acceptance tests focus on a feature and its interaction with the whole application. They try to simulate the user interaction with the application. All the elements of the application are tested together down to the database. This types of test are the harder to write.
