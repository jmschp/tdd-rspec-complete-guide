# 23. The context Method and Nested Describes

With the `describe` or `context` methods we can better organize our specs. When we notice that our examples might contain conditions, it might be a good idea to organize them in `describe` or `context` blocks.

The `describe` method is more commonly use to separate different method specs.

> Example group bodies (e.g. describe or context blocks) are evaluated in the context of a new subclass of ExampleGroup. Individual examples are evaluated in the context of an instance of the specific ExampleGroup subclass to which they belong.

```ruby
RSpec.describe Integer do
  describe '#even?' do
    # it 'should return true if number is even'
    # it 'should return false if number is odd'
    context 'when number is even' do
      it 'returns true' do
        expect(2.even?).to be(true)
      end
    end

    context 'when number is odd' do
      it 'returns false' do
        expect(3.even?).to be(false)
      end
    end
  end

  describe '#odd?' do
    context 'when number is even' do
      it 'returns false' do
        expect(2.odd?).to be(false)
      end
    end

    context 'when number is odd' do
      it 'returns true' do
        expect(3.odd?).to be(true)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The output will be indented acording to the `context` or `describe` methods.

```sh
rspec -- ./spec/context_spec.rb

Integer
  #even?
    when number is even
      returns true
    when number is odd
      returns false
  #odd?
    when number is even
      returns false
    when number is odd
      returns true
