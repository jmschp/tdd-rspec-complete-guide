# 20. Problems With Mutation

Since this is a regular ruby method, every time we reference `card` we are instantiating a new `Card` object.

```ruby
class Card
  attr_accessor :rank, :suit

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end
end

RSpec.describe Card do
  def card
    Card.new('Ace', 'Spades')
  end

  it 'has a rank' do
    expect(card.rank).to eq('Ace')
    card.rank = 'Queen'
    # this example would fail because we are instantiating an new instance of Card with rank Ace
    expect(card.rank).to eq('Queen')
  end

  it 'has a suite' do
    expect(card.suit).to eq('Spades')
  end
end
```
