# 01. Welcome to RSpec

## What is RSpec?

[RSpec](https://github.com/rspec) is a popular open-source library to test Ruby code. It was released in 2005, and the latest version at 17/01/2023 is 3, which continues under active development.

RSpec is a DSL (Domain Specific Languages) for testing. Its classes and methods are design to use under the testing domain.

## Why to test code?

Testing is writing code that checks if other code is working as expected. And it brings several benefits to the software development process.

> - Avoid regressions when new feature are added.
> - Provides a living documentation for teh codebase.
> - Isolate specific problme or bugs.
> - Improve the qualaty of the code, especially design.
> - Cut down developer time.

### Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development means writing the tests before writing actual code for the application. On one the main benefits of TDD is that it forces a developer to think how the application is going to function and what it needs to build it.

## The RSpec Ecosystem

The [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec) consists of 3 independent Ruby Gems that are often used together:

- [rspec-core](https://github.com/rspec) is the base library that organizes and runs the tests.
- [rspec-expectations](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations) is the matcher library that implements assertions.
- [rspec-mocks](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks) is a library used to fake behavior of classes and objects.

It also permits integration with other libraries for expectations and mocks.

The [rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) Gem integrates RSpec with the Ruby on Rails web framework.

## Project Structure

Most project using RSpec will have a `spec` directory, where the RSpec files will be. The sub-folders, under the `spec` directory, mimic the structure of the directories od the app we are testing. So for example if we are testing a Ruby o Rails application, the sub-folders in `spec` will have a similar structure to the `app` folder of the application.

An Rpsec file ends with a suffix `_spec.rb` extension and the rest of the name matches the file it is testing.
