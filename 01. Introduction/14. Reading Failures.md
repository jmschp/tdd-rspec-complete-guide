# 14. Reading Failures

To run our spec we use the RSpec CLI. Using only the command `rspec` is going to run all the specs in our specs folder. We can pass to it a file path to only run a single file.

Using the `rspec --format documentation` option the output will be similar to the example below.

```sh
rspec -- spec/card_spec.rb

Card
  has a type (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Card has a type
     Failure/Error: card = Card.new('Ace of Spades')

     NameError:
       uninitialized constant Card
     # ./spec/card_spec.rb:5:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.00052 seconds (files took 0.04366 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/card_spec.rb:4 # Card has a type
```
