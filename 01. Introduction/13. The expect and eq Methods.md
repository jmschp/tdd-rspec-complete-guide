# 13. The expect and eq Methods

Within the body of the `it` method block, we can write our expectations. To do this we start with the `expect` method. The `expect` method is followed by the `to` method, to which we pass a matcher.

Within a single example we can have multiple expectations. Although depending on the use case it might be better to separate the expectation between examples.

```ruby
RSpec.describe Card do
  it 'has a type' do
    card = Card.new('Ace of Spades')
    expect(card.type).to eq('Ace of Spades')
  end
end
```
