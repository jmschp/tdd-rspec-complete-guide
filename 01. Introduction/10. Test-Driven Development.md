# 10. Test-Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process, where we first write the test, and then the actual implementation code of the software.

The process usually follows this steps, usually know as the red-green-refactor cycle:

1. Write tests (red test are failing).
2. Write application code to pass the test (green test are passing).
3. Refactor code to cleanup (refactor time).

With this approach to software development, it might take us more time in the initial phase of the application to advance with the development, but in the long run we will have a fully tested application, which will bring benefits like confidence to later refactoring the application.

More importantly TDD force a developer to think about what he is going to build, and how, step by step.
