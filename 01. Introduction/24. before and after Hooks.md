# 24. before and after Hooks

We have the following contexts to run `before` or `after` hooks:

- `before :suite`
- `before :context` run one time only, before all of the examples in a group
- `before :example` run before each example
- `after :example` run after each example
- `after :context` run one time only, after all of the examples in a group
- `after :suite`

The `example` context is the default. So `before(:example)` is the same as just `before`. The same applies to `after(:example)`.

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'before and after hooks' do
  before(:context) do
    puts 'Before context'
  end

  after(:context) do
    puts 'After context'
  end

  before(:example) do
    puts 'Before example'
  end

  after(:example) do
    puts 'After example'
  end

  it 'is just a random example' do
    puts 'In example 1'
    expect(5 * 4).to eq(20)
  end

  it 'is just another random example' do
    puts 'In example 2'
    expect(3 - 2).to eq(1)
  end
end
```

This will produce the following output:

```sh
rspec -- ./spec/before_and_after_spec.rb

before and after hooks
Before context
Before example
In example 1
After example
  is just a random example
Before example
In example 2
After example
  is just another random example
After context
