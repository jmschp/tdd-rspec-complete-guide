# 12. The it Method

With the `it` key keyword we create a single example (test case) within an example group. This method takes as argument a string, optional metadata and a block.

The string we pass to `it` should be a readable, like sentence that describes some feature or functionality that we are going to build.

We can also use `specify` instead of `it`. Useful for when your string does not read well off of `it`.

```ruby
RSpec.describe Card do
  it 'has a type' do
  end
end
```
