# 11. The describe Method

The `describe` keyword, creates an example group, and it is used to describe what we are testing. It takes as an argument a string or a class, optional metadata, and a block. This example group is going to contain several related examples, which in RSpec world are test.

Although we can call `describe` with a docstring or a object, if we are actually testing the implementation for a specific class, it is best to use the class as an argument for `describe`. This way RSpec will provide some helper methods, like `described_class`.

```ruby
RSpec.describe Card do
end
```
