# 15. Making the Specs Pass

The idea behind TDD, red -> green -> refactor cycle, is that we run our specs see what's failing, then fix the current errors, run the specs again, and we probably have new errors, we fix the new errors, and continue in this cycle until all the specs pass. Once we have fully green specs we can refactor our code to make it clean.

In the beginin we probaly will have some Ruby errors, like in the example below `NameError: uninitialized constant Card`.

```sh
rspec -- spec/card_spec.rb

Card
  has a type (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Card has a type
     Failure/Error: card = Card.new('Ace of Spades')

     NameError:
       uninitialized constant Card
     # ./spec/card_spec.rb:7:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.00052 seconds (files took 0.04375 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/card_spec.rb:6 # Card has a type
```

We might then get to a point that our failures are actual expectation failures.

```sh
rspec -- spec/card_spec.rb

Card
  has a type (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Card has a type
     Failure/Error: expect(card.type).to eq('Ace of Spades')

       expected: "Ace of Spades"
            got: nil

       (compared using ==)
     # ./spec/card_spec.rb:8:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.00624 seconds (files took 0.04362 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/card_spec.rb:6 # Card has a type
```

We procced with development until we have a passing spec.

```sh
rspec -- spec/card_spec.rb

Card
  has a type

Finished in 0.00066 seconds (files took 0.04369 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```
