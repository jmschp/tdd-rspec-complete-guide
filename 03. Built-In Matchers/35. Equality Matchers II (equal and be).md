# 35. Equality Matchers II (equal and be)

The `equal` or the alias `be` matcher, checks for object identity. In the example below the variables `c` and `d`, although they store an identical array `[1, 2, 3]`, this are two different object in memory, so the are not `equal`. The variable `e` points to the variable `c`, so pointing to the same object in memory, so they are `equal`.

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'equality matchers' do
  describe 'equal and be matcher' do
    let(:c) { [1, 2, 3] }
    let(:d) { [1, 2, 3] }
    let(:e) { c }

    it 'cares about object identity' do
      expect(c).to equal(e) # passes if c.equal?(e)
      expect(c).to be(e) # passes if c.equal?(e)

      expect(c).not_to equal(d)
      expect(c).not_to equal([1, 2, 3])
    end
  end
end
```
