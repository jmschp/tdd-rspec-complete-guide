# 37. Predicate Matchers

A predicate method in Ruby is a method that returns a boolean. Usually as a conventions this methods are suffixed with an `?`. A few examples below of Ruby build-in predicate methods.

```ruby
7.zero?                   # => false
0.zero?                   # => true
1.odd?                    # => true
2.even?                   # => true
[1].empty?                # => false
[].empty?                 # => true
{ :a => 5 }.has_key?(:b)  # => false
{ :b => 5 }.has_key?(:b)  # => true
```

We can use RSpec predicate matcher with any of the built-in predicate methods or even custom built predicate methods. We just need to prefix the method with `be_` and remove the `?`. For methods that start with `has_`, like the above example `has_key?`, we can replace the `has_` with `have_` and remove the `?`.

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'predicate methods and predicate matchers' do
  it 'can be tested with Ruby methods' do
    result = 16 / 2
    expect(result.even?).to eq(true)
  end

  it 'can be tested with predicate matchers' do
    expect(16 / 2).to be_even
    expect(15).to be_odd
    expect(0).to be_zero
    expect([]).to be_empty
  end

  it 'can be tested with predicate matchers that start with has_' do
    expect({ a: 3 }).to have_key(:a)
  end

  describe 0 do
    it { is_expected.to be_zero }
  end
end
```
