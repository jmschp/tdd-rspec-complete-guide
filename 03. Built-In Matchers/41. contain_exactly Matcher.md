# 41. contain_exactly Matcher

> The contain_exactly matcher provides a way to test arrays against each other in a way that disregards differences in the ordering between the actual and expected array.
>
> This matcher is also available as match_array, which expects the expected array to be
> given as a single array argument rather than as individual splatted elements.

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'contain_exactly matcher' do
  subject { [1, 2, 3] }

  describe 'long form syntax' do
    it 'checks for the presence of all elements' do
      expect(subject).to contain_exactly(1, 2, 3)
      expect(subject).to contain_exactly(3, 2, 1)
      expect(subject).to contain_exactly(2, 1, 3)

      expect(subject).to contain_exactly(1, 2) # fail
      expect(subject).to contain_exactly(1, 2, 3, 4) # fail
    end
  end

  it { is_expected.to contain_exactly(1, 2, 3) }
  it { is_expected.to contain_exactly(3, 1, 2) }
  it { is_expected.to contain_exactly(2, 3, 1) }

  describe 'match_array' do
    it 'checks for the presence of all elements' do
      expect(subject).to match_array [1, 2, 3]
      expect(subject).to match_array [3, 2, 1]
      expect(subject).to match_array [2, 1, 3]
    end
